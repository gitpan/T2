Description:  Tangram 2 utility functions
 The T2 namespace is for a Tangram Schema classes, well actually a set
 of classes that can themselves be stored in a Tangram store, that can
 also generate a Tangram 2 schema.
 .
 This might be the beginnings of a refactoring of Tangram to be more
 Schema-centric; on the other hand it might not.
 .
 At the very least, it's the base for the Tangram Schema editor, a PSA
 application.
