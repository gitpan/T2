README for T2 0.09
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This module implements schema management and class auto-generation for
Tangram.

It was also envisioned to be the centre for code refactoring of the
Tangram core, providing API compatibility - however this has been
dropped as a goal of the module, and it is now focused on the Schema
as a data object.

To get started, run the test suite.  It will take you through setting
up a database to hold your schemas, itself a Tangram store.  The test
suite will use this database for its initial run.

After that, if you want to re-run the T2 test suite, you should create
another database for the tests.  The Makefile.PL re-creates database
tables when it is run, so only re-run it if you are sure you want to
lose the contents of the configured schema database.  If you name the
database ending in "_t", it is assumed that you are aware of this and
happy for Makefile.PL to blaze it.

ERRATA
~~~~~~
`perl Makefile.PL' will sometimes cause a segmentation fault.  This is
due to a bug in Storable.  The bug is tracked in the Perl bug tracker:

  http://guest:guest@rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=25145

This bug has since been fixed, so if you get it try to upgrade your
version of Storable.

SQLite
~~~~~~
SQLite has an outstanding bug in it too, which gives lots of messages
like this:

   Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.4/Tangram/Storage.pm line 693.

There is an RT ticket for that too,
